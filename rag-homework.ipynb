    "Chunks need to be vectorized and made accessible to an LLM to enable semantic search with embedding models. A current industry standard is to use a vector database to store and retrieve texts both conveniently and efficiently. There are many products out there, we'll be using [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/). LanceDB is a young product, one way it stands out is that it's embedded - it's designed not to be a standalone service but rather a part of an application, more on this [here](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/basic/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Feel free to explore other embedding models and justify your choice.\n",
    "For different embedding models and different chunking strategies create different tables in the database so you can easily switch between them and compare.\n",

    "### Step 3: Add a reranker\n",
    "\n",
    "A reranker is a second-level model which produces similarity scores for pairs of (input query + retrieved document). Cross-encoders are conventionally used for reranking, their architecture is slightly different from retrieval models (more on it [here] and [here](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html)). Cross-encoders are much more costly to run, therefore a retrieval model is used to get a few (dozens) highest-scoring items, and a reranker picks the best among these. The overall pipeline is similar to the recommender system indudustry standard: a light model retrieves top-n, a precise and heavy model reranks n to get top k, n is orders of magnitude larger than k.\n",

    "Cross-encoders are optional because of the overhead their usage implies. Your task is to implement a reranker using a cross-encoder and assess pros and cons of having it.
